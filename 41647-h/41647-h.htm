  <p><span class="name">Mil.</span> No, Tom, you’ve done it very well.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> (<i>rises and sits beside her, arm round her waist</i>) Say “Yes,” then. Of course, I’m not good enough for a girl like you. But I may be some day. My brother Ned’s a confirmed bachelor, and it’s just on the cards I may be the next Earl of Normantower.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Mil.</span> Yes, Tom, that’s just it. I’m not fit to be a Countess.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Not fit to be a Countess? Why, some of ’em are awful.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Mil.</span> My brother wouldn’t hear of it, I’m sure.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> Well, then, you shan’t be a Countess. A confirmed bachelor’s always the first to get married; and if Ned has a family, I shan’t come in for the title. You wouldn’t mind being Mrs. Verinder, would you?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Mil.</span> Oh, Tom! I know ought to say I should, but I shouldn’t.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> (<i>half embracing her</i>) Say “Yes,” then.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> I? I was reading Hiawatha.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> You don’t say so! (<i>picking up the thread and drawing them together</i>) Now, how dare you tell me such stories?

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> Making love at ten o’clock in the morning? I’m ashamed of you. It’s almost as bad as playing cards by daylight.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Tom.</span> (<span class="stage">C.</span>) I want her to marry me and she won’t! She says my family’s too good for her—as if anything could be too good for Mildred! I’m sure the Verinders are poor enough. As for me, she forgets my father was cut off with a shilling, and blew’d the lot?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> (<span class="stage">R.C.</span>) Blew’d the lot.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> I have always supposed so.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Error, sir. You tell us everything we tell you. The only difference is, you tell us in English, and we tell you in Latin. You take a fee out of your pocket; we put one in ours.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> (<i>smiling</i>) A great deal unhappily.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Vulgar fallacy. A patient’s complaint concerns nobody but his doctor. (<i>feels pulse—watch in hand</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> I have no energy. I don’t take my usual interest in what goes on around me. One day I’m restless—another, lethargic. There’s nothing particular the matter with me, but I seem to have no pleasure in existence; and instead of getting better, I get worse.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> (<i>shuts watch</i>) Happy at home? (<i>after feeling his hand</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Perfectly.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> How has your marriage answered?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> My wife is simply a treasure.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> (<i>dryly</i>) Oh! Any money difficulties?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> None. My father left me beyond reach of any trouble of that sort.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> I see, Miss Derwent is still with you.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> And I hope, will remain. Beatrice wouldn’t be without her for the world, and I think Mildred almost worships her. I can’t sufficiently thank you for the introduction.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> It varies.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> I thought Miss Derwent would suit you. I picked her up at Guy’s. She was a nurse there. Something about her struck me. Has it struck you?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Shall I tell you the truth?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Of course.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> I don’t know.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Surely, with your experience——</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Sir, I have no experience.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Well, with your knowledge——</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Sir, I have no knowledge. Knowledge is the monopoly of extremely young practitioners. I have been doctoring for forty years; and now, I stand here on your hearthrug, sir, a monument of triumphant ignorance.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> Dignity? My dear Phil, I have no dignity. I am a born Bohemian, and the idea of me dropping in for a peerage strikes me as so ludicrous, I’ve done nothing but laugh ever since I became a hereditary legislator. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> (<i>sits in chair <span class="stage">R.</span> of sofa</i>) Ah, well, I’ll do my best; but ten thousand a year, paid quarterly in advance, would have suited Ned Verinder’s book better than an empty honour without a shilling to support it.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> (<i>crosses to <span class="name">Lord Normantower</span></i>) Well, there’s one consolation.

(<i><span class="name">Beatrice</span> enters, <span class="stage">C.</span>, from <span class="stage">R.,</span> pausing to look in at window, <span class="stage">R.C.</span>, and comes down behind chair, <span class="stage">R.C.</span></i>) At the time, there was not the remotest likelihood of my ever succeeding to the title, and of course I was hard up. I always was. A gilded calf appeared upon the scene; and the charming woman wrote me a charming letter, protesting eternal fidelity, and announcing her approaching marriage.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> To the calf?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> To the gilt.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> You had a lucky escape.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> Luckier than I thought: for I discovered afterwards that the charming creature was a regular adventuress—a garrison hack—a boarding-house belle—the sole support of an aged father—a venerable old gentleman, with the manners of a patriarch and the morals of a welsher! She was a charming woman, for all that.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> I congratulate you on your escape. But who was the unfortunate calf?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> I never took the trouble to inquire.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> (<i>advancing—all start slightly as before</i>) And the charming creature? Pray, who was she? (<i><span class="stage">C.R.</span> of <span class="name">Philip</span></i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> (<i>rises</i>) Miss Challoner!</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> (<i>proudly—introducing <span class="name">Beatrice</span></i>) My wife. (<i><span class="name">Normantower</span> bows</i>) You know one another.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> (<i>with perfect self-possession</i>) I believe, now that I see Lord Normantower, I once had the pleasure of meeting him. (<i>crosses to <span class="name">Normantower</span></i>) Let me see—where was it?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> It sounds ungallant to say so, but I really forget for the moment.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> Well, never mind that now. Tell us who was the lady who used you so shamefully. I am dying to know. (<i>looking him straight in the face</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> You must excuse me. Though I am ungallant enough to forget where I met Mrs. Selwyn, I am not so unchivalrous as to betray a lady’s secret. (<i>moves away to <span class="stage">L.C.</span> in front of sofa</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> (<i>goes to <span class="name">Philip</span>, <span class="stage">R.C.</span></i>) Phil, dear, your friend is quite a hero of romance. If you have any more such friends, please lose no time in introducing them.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> My love, don’t make me jealous. (<i><span class="name">Beatrice</span> goes to <span class="name">Normantower.</span>  <span class="name">Philip</span> turns and speaks to <span class="name">Sir Peter</span></i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> (<i>giving her hand frankly to <span class="name">Normantower</span></i>) Thank you, Lord Normantower.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> (<i>taking her hand, rather disconcerted</i>) For what, Mrs. Selwyn?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> For your loyalty—to my sex. (<i>turns off up stage to back of table, calling <span class="name">Sir Peter,</span> who rises and joins her. She shows him a book, which she takes from table</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> (<i>crosses to <span class="name">Normantower,</span>  takes his arm, and draws him back to sofa</i>) You’ve had a narrow escape, evidently; but don’t make the mistake of letting the unworthiness of one woman blind you to the merits of the rest. Believe me, there is no happiness like that of married love. (<i>sits on sofa. <span class="name">Sir Peter</span> is looking at book; <span class="name">Beatrice</span> listening to conversation</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> (<i>sits <span class="stage">L.</span> of <span class="name">Philip</span></i>) Love! there is no such thing. We think we are in love, but we aren’t. What is called love is an affliction of the brain, not an affection of the heart. Luckily, we soon get over it.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> Men may—but women, never. Do they, Sir Peter?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> I never offer an opinion on matters I don’t understand—(<i>lifting his forefinger</i>)—unless, mark, they are strictly medical. Love has no place in the British pharmacopæa. (<i>goes down <span class="stage">R.</span> of table, <span class="name">Beatrice</span> <span class="stage">L.</span> of it.

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Yet it exists. I have even known cases of love at sight.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> Love at sight! Now you’re going too far for anything. I can imagine an enthusiast believing even in love, but love at sight! (<i>rises</i>) No, my dear Phil, that’s too ridicu—— (<i>a tennis ball comes flying in from the grounds, rolling down to <span class="stage">L.</span> corner; <span class="name">Normantower</span> picks it up and gets <span class="stage">L.C.</span></i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> (<span class="stage">L.</span>) That’s Miss Derwent.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> And who is Miss Derwent?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> (<span class="stage">R.C.</span>) Only a companion. (<i>coldly</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> You’ll be delighted with her, when you know her, as of course you will, if you stay with us for a week or two.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> (<i>watch</i>) Well, my ten minutes are up. (<i>crosses to <span class="stage">C.</span></i>) Before I go I’d like to see you alone. (<i>to <span class="name">Philip</span></i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> You have been misinformed. There is not a word of truth in what you have heard about me.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> No doubt. People exaggerate so. (<i>standing below her</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> They invent so.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> They invent so.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> And you have believed them! What must you think of me? (<i>moves away a little</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> To be perfectly frank, Mrs. Selwyn, I endeavour not to think of you at all. (<i>goes to fireplace <span class="stage">R.</span></i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> (<i>goes up to <span class="stage">L.</span> of table</i>) You have forgotten me? You have stripped me from your mind?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> (<i>goes up to <span class="stage">C.</span></i>) Ah! it is easy to talk of one’s duty but it is not always so easy to do it. (<i><span class="name">Normantower</span> looks at her</i>) Ned—may I call you so? Let me tell you the secret of my life.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> You have a secret? (<i>comes to her <span class="stage">C.</span></i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> Yes—<i>I</i> was always constant. I was forced into this marriage. The letter I wrote breaking off our engagement was dictated to me. I never loved my husband. (<i>turns away to <span class="stage">L.C.</span></i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> (<span class="stage">C.</span>) Mrs. Selwyn, you forget, your husband is my friend. If you didn’t know it when he asked me here, you know it now.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> (<i>turns to him</i>) I always knew it. It was I who suggested the invitation. I could bear my unhappiness no longer. I felt I must see you again. Oh, if you could only look into my heart! Ned! Though I used you badly, you<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-17">[Pg 17]</a></span> are bitterly avenged! (<i>drops into sofa <span class="stage">L.C.</span>, and buries her face in her hands</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> (<i>goes up to head of sofa, looking down on her</i>) I have no wish to be avenged. I loved you—I lost you—and there is an end of it. (<i>turns up <span class="stage">C.</span></i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> (<i>rising</i>) Why was I born a woman? (<i>crosses to <span class="stage">R.C.</span> corner of table</i>) Why was I not a man? To amuse myself just for the moment, and then to be able to forget!</p>

  <p><span class="name">Nor.</span> (<i>comes down behind chair <span class="stage">R.C.</span></i>) You do us an injustice. We men are not so inconstant as you think.

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Are you sorry you changed your position?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> No, Sir Peter. I have been very happy here. Mr. Selwyn has always treated me with such consideration that, I am afraid, sometimes I forget that I am not one of the family; Mrs. Selwyn has never been <i>unkind</i> to me, and Mildred I have learnt to love almost as a sister.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Good. My object in introducing you here being accomplished, I feel myself at liberty to explain it. The medical profession has its romantic episodes. I am going to tell you one.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> Go on. I love romances. (<i>faces <span class="name">Sir Peter</span></i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Three years ago, a patient of mine died—nothing remarkable in that—it’s a habit my patients have—leaving a grown-up son and a young daughter to inherit his very considerable fortune. He died beloved by his children and respected by all who knew him, but on his deathbed he confided to me a secret. He was a thief and a bigamist. When very young he had married a rich lady. This marriage he had concealed, and under a false name had married again. For some years he had lived a double life and had two families. By his first and lawful wife he had one child—a daughter; and having contrived to possess himself of the whole of this lady’s fortune, ultimately he deserted her. The fortune of the first wife he left to his children by the second, who are to this day quite unconscious of their father’s crime.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> Sir Peter!</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> In his later years, he had searched privately for his first wife and child, but he could find no trace of them. That search he bequeathed to me, and a pretty legacy it’s been! For a long time my inquiries were unavailing, but at last I discovered that the mother was dead.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> And the daughter?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Was one of my own nurses at Guy’s Hospital.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> At Guy’s!</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> I had known her by sight for months, but had not happened to hear her name—Kate Derwent.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> (<i>rising</i>) I?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Sit down. (<i><span class="name">Kate</span> sinks back into seat</i>) What was I<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-20">[Pg 20]</a></span> to do? All this man’s children were my personal friends. The two, who had legally inherited your mother’s fortune, morally were not entitled to a shilling. You, who legally are penniless, morally are entitled to it all. If ever there was a case for an amicable arrangement, this was one; and I thought it would facilitate a settlement, if you were all made acquainted with one another. With that object I introduced you into this house.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> Surely you cannot mean——</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> I can—I do.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> Then, let them never know it. (<i>crosses to <span class="stage">R.C.</span>, <span class="stage">L.</span> of table</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Nonsense. I must see you properly provided for.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> I am provided for. (<i>gets <span class="stage">C.</span></i>) I have earned my living for years, and I can earn it to the end. I am not used to wealth, and should not know what to do with it. They are, and could not be happy without it. Let them remain in ignorance of the truth.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> (<i>rises and goes towards her, <span class="stage">C.</span></i>) Miss Derwent, you are a most extraordinary person. I tell you, you are entitled to a fortune, and you don’t ask how much it is. A woman—and no curiosity.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> I don’t care how much it is or how little. I don’t want to know. (<i>turns away to front of table</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> This is a matter of no less than two hundred thousand pounds. Well?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> I said nothing.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Then will you please say something?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> I have nothing to say.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> A woman—and nothing to say. You regard two<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-21">[Pg 21]</a></span> hundred thousand pounds with contempt. Think, how many new frocks it would buy. (<i>going to her</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> I do not regard money with contempt; for money can sometimes buy happiness. But we are all perfectly happy as we are. Why do you want to disturb us?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> (<i><span class="stage">R.</span> of table</i>) You think only of the present; but consider the future. Some day, you may have a daughter of your own——</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> No, I shall never marry.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Never what?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> I am in earnest. (<i>goes down a few steps, <span class="stage">R.C.</span></i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> A woman—and not want to be married! Hang me, if I believe you’re a woman at all! (<i>goes to <span class="stage">L.C.</span></i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> Why? Because I want to be generous?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> (<i>above <span class="name">Kate</span></i>) Miss Derwent, there is a higher virtue than generosity, and that is justice. It is easy enough to be generous, but it hard indeed to be just—especially to oneself. This is a question of pounds, shillings, and pence.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> (<i>works up to <span class="stage">C.</span></i>) Pardon me, Sir Peter—this is a question of breaking the hearts of those who were kind to me when I needed kindness, who befriended me when I was alone in the world, whom I have already learned to love almost as what they are—my brother and sister. Their father—my father—is dead, but his memory is dear to them. I know they loved him—and I know they honoured him. How can I imperil that love, and how can I stultify that honour? How can I cloud the sunshine of my sister’s life with the shadow of her father’s sin? No, Sir Peter! If that is justice, justice is beyond me. I am only equal to generosity. I <i>am</i> a woman, only a woman—and I can’t do it. Not for a hundred fortunes! Not for all the world. (<i>goes to <span class="stage">L.</span> of table and sits</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> (<i>goes up to <span class="stage">C.</span></i>) Yes, you are a woman after all—and as self-willed and silly as the rest. To throw away two hundred thousand pounds! Why, I’ve decimated my fellow creatures for half that. It’s wicked—positively wicked. You deserve to die in a ditch.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> (<i>rises</i>) I will die where heaven wills it, but I shall at least have the consciousness that I have done something to repair my father’s wrong.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Rubbish—romantic rubbish.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> Promise me that you will keep this secret—that you will say nothing to my brother—promise me, Sir Peter.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> I shall promise nothing. I shall use my own discretion, as I always do. (<i>turns off, <span class="stage">L.C.</span></i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> Yes—I’ve been saying good-bye to all my favourites. (<i>pause—<span class="name">Beatrice</span> takes up a book—<span class="name">Kate</span> goes on watering the plants</i>) How is Mr. Selwyn this morning?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> He is not so well. (<i>her back is towards <span class="name">Kate</span></i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> I’m sorry to hear that. I hope he will be well enough to shake hands with me before I go.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> Then you are determined to leave us?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> (<i>leaves can up <span class="stage">R.C.</span>, and comes down <span class="stage">C.</span></i>) I can’t tell you how sorry I am, but I mustn’t stop here for ever. Mildred learnt all that I can teach her long ago; and if I stay much longer, I shall be the pupil. Since Mr. Verinder’s arrival I have had several lessons in the English language as it is spoken at Eton, and I flatter myself I shall soon be able to “cackle” as well as if I wore a remarkably short jacket and remarkably tight inexpressibles.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> You under-rate your accomplishments. <i>I</i> don’t think there is <i>much</i> that Mildred could teach you.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> You make <i>me</i> blush sometimes.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> Then you ought to be extremely obliged to me, for nothing becomes you better. (<i>grimaces as before</i>) Mrs. Selwyn, we are now quite old friends.

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> (<i>smiling</i>) It’s a very simple one—Arsenic.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> Does it? Where do you get it?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> From the chemist’s, of course.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> But will they sell it you?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> Yes, if you’re candid and confide in them. My love, if you want to look better than Nature intended you——</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> Confide in your chemist. Make some ridiculous excuse—say that the family cat is in convulsions—and they will sell you nothing. They know it’s absurd. Say that you want to improve your complexion, and they will sell you anything; they know it’s the truth.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> I ought to get better, if the best of doctors and the most devoted of nurses are of any use; but somehow I don’t.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> You get worse. (<i><span class="stage">R.</span> of sofa</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> I shouldn’t mind so much, if I didn’t find my temper giving way—just now, I spoke quite crossly to poor little Mousey here (<i>takes her hand</i>)—and she was only carrying out your instructions. (<i>to <span class="name">Sir Peter</span></i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> The fact is, doctor, he’s a very naughty boy, and won’t take his medicine, though I always give it him with my own hands. He hasn’t taken any to-day.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Oh, you won’t take your medicine?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> It’s such horrid stuff; and somehow, I always feel worse after taking it.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> So much the better. Shows it’s doing you good.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Yes, sir—you are.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> But if it’s only my liver.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> It is <i>not</i> your liver.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Is it my heart? Is anything wrong there?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Nothing of any consequence. It’s rather too large, and rather too soft—that’s all that’s wrong with your heart.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> What is it then?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> (<i>sits on sofa</i>) I can account for your condition, only on one hypothesis, and that one is out of the question.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Mayn’t I know what it is?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Since it’s out of the question, it’s no use discussing it. You haven’t answered me. Have you made your will?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Yes—long ago. It was a very simple matter. Mildred is provided for; so I have left everything to my wife, absolutely. (<i><span class="name">Sir Peter</span> rises and rings the bell, below fire, crossing in front</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Sir Peter, you are incomprehensible!</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Let me make myself clear. Your father, Philip Selwyn, was married to your mother, Mildred Kent, in July, 1865. I need not show you the certificate.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Of course not.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Two years before, in March, 1863, one Philip Derwent was married to one Kate Graham.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Derwent? Kate? Miss Derwent’s father, I presume?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Yes. There is the certificate.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> I don’t want to see it.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> But I want you to see it. (<i>gives it to <span class="name">Philip</span></i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> (<i>glances at it and returns it</i>) How does it concern me?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> It concerns <i>her</i>, doesn’t it?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Of course.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> And she being your half-sister, it concerns <i>you</i>.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Miss Derwent, my half-sister! What do you mean?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> That Philip Selwyn and Philip Derwent were one and the same person.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Sir Peter!</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Of that I have no proof, except your father’s word.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> My father’s word?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Given to me on his death-bed. Do you <i>doubt</i> his word? Do you doubt mine?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> No—but I cannot grasp it! Am I awake, or am I dreaming? I have such strange dreams.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> You are awake—and for the first time in your life. Till to-day, you have been living in a dream.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> My father was a widower, when he married my mother? Why did he not say so? Why did he change his name?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Because he was <i>not</i> a widower.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Not a widower!</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Because his first wife was alive——</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Alive! (<i>leaning well forward</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> There is the certificate of her death—twenty years later.</p>

  <p class="scene2">(<i><span class="name">Philip</span> takes it, looks at it blankly, drops back into seat.</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> (<i>after a short pause</i>) Incredible!</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> I haven’t half done yet.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Go on—go on. (<i>leaning forward again to table and placing certificate on it</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> You inherited from your father everything you possess?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Everything!</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> He bequeathed to you, and your sister Mildred, all his fortune?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> All.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Where did he get that fortune?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Well?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> From his first wife.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> (<i>springing up</i>) It’s false! it <i>must</i> be false!</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> (<i>rises</i>) I have his word for it, and it can be proved. He left her penniless; and left his child to struggle with the world as best they could—and nobly they did it. Yes, sir, it is too true. The father you have loved and honoured <i>was</i>——</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> (<i>extending his arms, as if to stop <span class="name">Sir Peter</span></i>) My father! (<i><span class="name">Sir Peter</span> stands for a moment, nonplussed</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> Was your father—just so. (<i>turns off. <span class="name">Sir Peter</span> picks up certificate from table and goes to <span class="stage">R.C.</span> down stage, folding papers which he returns to his pocket, <span class="name">Philip</span> leans on mantel-piece—aside, looking at <span class="name">Philip</span></i>) Takes it very well.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> (<i>goes to <span class="stage">L.C.</span>, helping himself by table</i>) I want to ask you one question. Dare I? (<i>they stand looking at one another for an instant</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> You mean, your mother.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Yes.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> She knew nothing of this.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Thank heaven for that—thank heaven! (<i>falls heavily into sofa, and sobs upon the table</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> (<i><span class="stage">C.,</span> breaking out</i>) But you need not acknowledge me. I ask for nothing but to go away. Let the past be forgotten. Of what use is it to revive a sorrow that is dead, and to publish a sin that is unknown? (<i>to <span class="name">Sir Peter</span></i>) It cannot be right to make three beings unhappy, to do justice to one, when all that one asks is to go away.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> You know, then?</p>

All I ask is to go—let me go! let me go! (<i>goes to <span class="name">Sir Peter</span> who rises and checks her, and then sits again</i>)</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> Yes, all I have is hers. (<i>turning to <span class="name">Beatrice</span></i>) Beatrice, my father was not married to my mother legally—he was married before—Kate is his lawful child—the money he left me was her mother’s—and to her it must be restored, to the last shilling.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> (<i>rises</i>) Nonsense! this is quixotic!</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> (<i>peremptorily</i>) I know what my duty is, and it shall be done. (<i>to <span class="name">Beatrice</span></i>) Am I not right?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Phil.</span> (<i>goes to <span class="name">Kate,</span> <span class="stage">C.</span>, takes her hand and puts arm round her; to <span class="name">Kate</span></i>) You have battled with the world long enough.

(<i>goes slowly to <span class="name">Beatrice</span> and takes her hand</i>) Many things have been taken from me.

  <p><span class="name">Kate.</span> (<i>to <span class="stage">R.</span> of sofa, below it and kneels</i>) Do what is best for everyone. Accept a favour from a sister who asks you—on her knees! Keep our secret! Remain here—the master of Ravenhurst. Philip! For Mildred’s sake.</p>

Besides, though there was arsenic in the glass, there was <i>none in the bottle.</i> While you were all having your dinner, I took the liberty of analysing <i>that.</i> Mr. Selwyn is now in such a condition that the next dose may be fatal. The first thing to be done is, to protect his life. I have not left him since morning; but at the precise moment when the criminal, whoever it is, will probably administer the poison, I shall not be there to prevent it, because that moment will be when he takes the final dose of physic which I have ordered him, just before going to bed.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> Well? You were saying——</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> I suspect Miss Derwent—She has, as humanity goes, a powerful incentive to this crime. On Mr. Selwyn’s death, she expects to come into a large fortune.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> Not until he has made a will in her favour.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> He said he would make it to-day. She heard him say so, and she knows that he has seen his solicitor.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> (<i>sits on sofa</i>) Yes, but my husband has been ill some weeks. Miss Derwent had nothing to gain by his death until this will was made.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> (<i>sitting <span class="stage">R.</span> of her</i>) Therefore, she has not killed him. The process has been admirably timed. She began to compass his death when she had nothing to gain by it, and therefore was not open to suspicion; and on the point of its consummation, adroitly threw herself upon his generosity. You must admit the ingenuity of the scheme.</p>

  <p><span class="name">Bea.</span> But the evidence?</p>

  <p><span class="name">Sir P.</span> That is where you must help me. It is incomplete. But it is obvious enough, the criminal, whoever it is, is familiar with the properties of arsenic, which are not so simple as is commonly supposed. A bungler would have killed him long ago; but Miss Derwent is half a doctor. She was at Guy’s for years. She is a particular friend of Dr. Kennedy’s—and, strongest evidence of all, his book on toxicology is here—(<i>rises, crosses to piano, takes book, and recrosses to back of sofa, <span class="stage">R.</span> of it</i>) inscribed with her name—and has evidently been considerably studied.

    <p>This transcription is based on scanned images posted by Google from a copy in the Harvard Library:</p>

    <p class="center"><a href="http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.FIG:002663452">nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.FIG:002663452</a></p>

    <p class="noindent">Note that the Google scans are included in a set of four Sydney Grundy plays published by Samuel French posted under the title, <i>A Fool’s Paradise.</i> Based on how the Harvard Library catalogs the individual copies, I assume Google combined the different scans into a single document. <i>A Fool’s Paradise</i> is the first play in the set.</p>

    <p>French’s Acting Editions from the nineteenth century tend to have minor editorial inconsistencies and errors such as missing and inverted letters, missing and incorrect punctuation marks, and spelling errors. In addition, errors were introduced in the printing process, depending on the condition and inking of the plates. Thus, for example, it is at times difficult to determine whether a certain letter is an “c,” “e,” or “o” or whether a certain punctuation mark is a period or a comma. Where context made the choice obvious, the obvious reading was given the benefit of the doubt without comment.</p>

    <p>The following changes were noted:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Throughout the text, all abbreviations in the stage directions for stage position, entrances, and exits (e.g.,“R.I.D.”) have been made consistent so that there is no space between the letters.</li>

      <li>Throughout the text, the convention of long dashes at the end of lines has been made consistent.</li>

      <li>p. 3: Tennis bat for <span class="name">Kate</span> <span class="stage">R.U.E.</span>—For consistency, changed “<span class="name">Kate</span>” to “Kate”.</li>

      <li>p. 6: <span class="name">Kate</span> Why aren’t…—Added period after “<span class="name">Kate</span>”.</li>

    <p>The html version of this etext attempts to reproduce the layout of the printed text. However, some concessions have been made. For example, on pages 25, 34, and 39 of the printed text a single curly bracket around two or more lines is used to indicate simultaneous action or dialogue. It is possible to reproduce this in html using tables, but html tables may not transfer well to the Project Gutenberg files generated from the html file. Thus, the use of html tables was avoided.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
